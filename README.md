# Bookmarks

Over the years, I have been accumulating a long list of links to several
software packages as bookmarks in my browser. I regularly use many of these
bookmarks, but many others just represent a name and a link to something I have
never used. The reason to keep all these bookmarks is to have them at hand when
I may need them in the future. Having them in my browser is useful, but
sometimes I need to reach them from other devices and I thought that the
compiled list could be of interest to somebody else.

I include a brief explanation for each library. The explanation is just a
personal opinion on why this library looked interesting to me. If you feel that
the description is not accurate, or simply wrong, feel free to issue a pull
request.
