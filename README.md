# Bookmarks

Over the years, I have been accumulating a long list of links to several
software packages as bookmarks in my browser. I regularly use many of these
bookmarks, but many others just represent a name and a link to something I have
never used. The reason to keep all these bookmarks is to have them at hand when
I may need them in the future. Having them in my browser is useful, but
sometimes I need to reach them from other devices and I thought that the
compiled list could be of interest to somebody else. 

## Python language and compilations

Several pages have compiled the most popular libraries. These are exhaustive,
well maintained and documented. Therefore, instead of repeating all the
references in these pages, I include the compilation page and a short
description about it.

* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) - Python reference.
* [Python Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/) - A tour of the Python standard library through short examples.
* [Python Pedia](https://pythonpedia.com/) - Comprehensive list of references to most of the libraries I regularly use, grouped in very intuitive sections.
* [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html) - Everything you need to create, deploy and operate production Python web applications. Not restricted to Python.
* [Awesome Python](https://awesome-python.com/) - The most complete list of references, but a little bit difficult to browse due to the large number of sections.

## Interesting libraries

Even I have never used these libraries, I include a brief explanation for each
library. The explanation is just a personal opinion on why this library looked
interesting to me. If you feel that the description is not accurate, or simply
wrong, feel free to issue a pull request.

* [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/) - Python (2.5-2.7) library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH. It depends on [Paramiko](http://docs.paramiko.org/en/stable/), which I regularly use.
* [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) - Asynchronous task/job queue based on distributed message passing.
* [Django-river](http://django-river.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Workflow Library for Django.
* [Remi](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi) - A Platform independent Python GUI library for your applications
* [Ruffus](http://www.ruffus.org.uk/) - Computation pipeline library for python.
